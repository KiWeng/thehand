## TODOs

### Basics

- [x] A threejs rendered hand as background
- [x] Menu with following options:
    - [x] Begin calibration
    - [x] Load profile
        - [x] Popout dialog for model selection
    - [x] Begin prediction

### Calibration session

- [x] Post start&end request to the server
- [x] Show the calibration instructions
- [x] Set target model name
- [x] Show calibration states
- [ ] custom calibration menu

### Prediction session

- [ ] Post start&end request to the server
- [x] Receiving predicted data@50Hz with websocket
    - *@10-30Hz roughly due to the processing speed of the server*
- [x] Show hands

### Miscellaneous

- [ ] Show per-channel EMG data (not echarts, cost too much resource, cannot be realtime)

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely
be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (netlify, surge, now, etc.)
